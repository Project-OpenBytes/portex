OpenBytes Schema is a language for describing the data structure of the objects stored in the table.
It defines the name and the type of each table column. It also tells the data user how to access the
data in the table.

This Github project manages the source code of the OpenBytes Schema design document.

The full design document can be found in [documentation site](http://openbytes-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
